# Leiden
Parallel implementation Leidem Algorithm on GPUs

# **Introduction**
he Leiden algorithm is a popular method for community detection in networks, improving upon the Louvain algorithm by guaranteeing well-connected communities. While most existing implementations focus on undirected graphs and run on CPUs, this project introduces a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Leiden algorithm for directed graphs.
